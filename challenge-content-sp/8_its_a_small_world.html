  <p><strong>Collaborators</strong> are other GitHub users who are given permission to make edits to a repository owned by someone else. <strong>Contributors</strong> are other GitHub users who have made contributions to a project.</p>

  <h3>Hello, Repo Robot!</h3>
  <p>To add collaborators to one of your projects, visit the repository's page on your GitHub account and click the 'Settings' tab in the menu in the upper part of the page. Then select the 'Collaborators' option. Type the username into the text box add and click 'Add'.</p>

  <p>Go to your forked Patchwork repository's page on GitHub and add 'reporobot' as a collaborator. The URL should look like this, but with your username.</p>
