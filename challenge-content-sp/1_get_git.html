  <h2>Git</h2>
  <p>Git is free <strong>open source software</strong> (the <a href="https://github.com/git/git">source code is public</a>) written by Linus Torvalds who also wrote the Linux operating system. </p>
  <p>Git is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in programming as <strong>version control</strong>. If you've used a track changes feature in a text document then you're already familiar with the concept!</p>

  <h3>Install Git</h3>
  <p>We recommend installing Git on your computer by downloading the <a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a> app. We'll not use the desktop app in Git-it (we're learning terminal!) but it includes Git and is the easiest way to install Git on all platforms in the same way.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Windows</strong>: Use the <strong>Git Shell</strong> for your terminal.</li>
    <li><strong>Mac</strong>: Open GitHub Desktop and from Preferences, select the command line tools install. Use the <strong>terminal</strong> app as your terminal.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Already have Git or not sure? Type <code>git --version</code> in your terminal and if it returns a version number higher than <code>1.7.10</code>, you're set! For more information, visit the <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git website</a>.</p>

  <p>Git isn't like other programs on your computer. You'll likely not see an icon on your desktop, but it will always be available to you and you'll be able to access it at anytime from your terminal or Git desktop applications.</p>

<h3>Configure Git</h3>
  <p>Once Git is installed, open your <strong>terminal</strong>.
  You can verify that it's really there by typing:</p>

  <p><code class="shell">git --version </code></p>

  <p>This will return the version of Git that you're running and look something like this:</p>

  <p><code>git version 1.9.1</code></p>

  <p>Next, configure Git so it knows to associate your work to you:</p>
  <p>Set your name:</p>
  <p><code class="shell">git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code></p>
  <p>Now set your email:</p>
  <p><code class="shell">git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"</code></p>

  <h3>Dollar Signs in Code Documentation</h3>
  <p>Dollar signs <code>$</code> are often used in programming documentation to signify that the line is <strong>command line</strong> code (see the code snippets above). You don't actually type the <code>$</code> in though, only type what comes after.</p>
